# https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-eacl.117/

# JBLiMP is a novel dataset for targeted syntactic evaluations of 
# language models in Japanese. JBLiMP consists of 331 minimal pairs, 
# which are created based on acceptability judgments extracted from journal 
# articles in theoretical linguistics. These minimal pairs are grouped into 
# 11 categories, each covering a different linguistic phenomenon.
